# explore.gjs

I experiment with gnome and gnome javascript (gjs) in this repository; learn by doing.

## background

[gjs](https://gjs-docs.gnome.org/gjs/) is gnome's javascript interpreter and runtime. It's ES6-like, and now supports ES6 modules.
It has a [guide](https://gjs.guide/guides/) and the beginnings of [a book](https://rmnvgr.gitlab.io/gtk4-gjs-book/). When you install gnome, you get gjs and it's "supporting objects".

## gjs

* [gjs-jasmine](https://github.com/ptomato/jasmine-gjs) for testing

## gnome

* [gnome dev](https://apps.gnome.org/#development) including the api resource [Devhelp](https://apps.gnome.org/Devhelp/)
* [getting started](https://developer.gnome.org/documentation/tutorials/beginners/getting_started.html), a part of the [platform documentation](https://developer.gnome.org/documentation/introduction.html) alongside additional [tutorials](https://developer.gnome.org/documentation/tutorials.html)
* [gtk4+rust](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/latest/book/)
* [reddit r/gnome](https://www.reddit.com/r/gnome)
* [gnome discourse](https://discourse.gnome.org/)
* [matrix](https://matrix.org/docs/chat_basics/matrix-for-im/) using [fractal](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal) by recipe https://wiki.gnome.org/GettingInTouch/Matrix with provider https://app.element.io/#/welcome into room(?) https://app.element.io/#/home (tbs, fractal doesn't work for me yet).


## {java,type}script

* [mdn javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) including a [guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide) and language [reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference).
* [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) including [the handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) and an [index of topics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)


## todo

* gjs in typescript say using the [swc compiler](https://swc.rs/) and perhaps https://gjsify.org/? More at https://blogs.gnome.org/christopherdavis/2022/08/25/trying-typescript-for-gnome-apps/ and perhaps https://github.com/gjsify/ts-for-gir
